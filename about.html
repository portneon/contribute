        <h2>What is Git?</h2>   

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in source code during software development.
It helps developers collaborate, manage projects, and maintain the history of changes.
Key Features of Git:

Distributed System: Every developer has a full copy of the repository on their system.
Version Tracking: Tracks changes and allows reverting to previous versions.
Branching and Merging: Enables working on multiple features simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.
Lightweight: Efficient and fast for large projects.

        THis is just an random paragrpah:During one such summer vacation, I was assigned the homework to build a model of a volcano. I, like an obedient student, noted it down in my diary and came back home. Every year, my plan for summer vacation was to finish the homework in the first couple of weeks itself and then spend the rest of the vacation chilling out, but that never happened. That year wasn’t different. But it was different in a sense. I did finish all my homework in first few weeks and spent the last few weeks making the volcano.

        Now, before I tell anything further, let me tell you that I’ve realized that I’ve inherited, not cultivated, my gene of ‘building’ things. Everyone in my family appreciates making stuff. I was told by my classmates that there are shops in the market that sold these pre-built models of globes and volcanos. I presented the proposal to my father, who straight away denied stating the reason, “If you’ll build, you’ll learn. If you don’t, you won’t.”
        
        I wasn’t really happy about the situation because making the model would take away at least a week out of my chilling time. Nevertheless, I started making. I started by zeroing on a solid base, which I made out of a thick plywood. I coated the plywood with paper mash to give it a texture. I then started looking out for a foundational shape on top of which I could build my volcano. I found an unused earthen utensil.
        
        By this time, I was joined by my brothers in helping me build the volcano. I decided to cover the earthen utensil using paper mash in the shape of a volcano and planned to color it in bright red as if lava is pouring out. Apparently, the plan didn’t impress my brothers. They said, “Paper mash?! Really?! Bad choice. You’ll paint the lava?! Bad choice again. If we are doing it, then let’s do it properly.” Then they concluded their complaints with the phrase, “LAVA MUST FLOW.”
        
        We threw away my paper mash base, and instead built again using plaster of Paris. We used the earthen utensil and erected a pipe in the center of it before covering it up with thick layers of plaster of Paris. We then brought out our set of oil colors and colored it in not just bright red, but in the shades of black, green and red. The project took us a week to complete, and it looked like a real volcano, not the ones you see in cartoons.
        
        It was the time for lava. My elder brother mixed red food color and baking soda and poured it in the pipe that made the mouth of the volcano. We left it to dry under the sun and within a day, it was ready. It turned out to be quite heavy. I remember, how when the schools reopened, I was holding the model of volcano wrapped in the newspaper and was trying to find a seat on the school bus.
        
        Upon reaching the school, everyone kept their models in a corner of the class. Everyone who was assigned the homework to make the model of the volcano had submitted very similar looking models as if one person made them all. I realized my model was way different than theirs. I liked mine but I was embarrassed to reveal my over-engineered model and therefore, I submitted mine covered in the newspaper. I didn’t unwrap it.
        Everyone, one by one, showed their models to the teacher and got the marks awarded for it. The teacher too mentioned, “You weren’t supposed to buy the models. You were supposed to make them yourself.” At that point, I wanted to stand up and tell the teacher that I had made mine and it sat in the corner of the class wrapped under the newspapers. But I didn’t. More than pride, I was embarrassed to have such a different volcano than everyone else.
